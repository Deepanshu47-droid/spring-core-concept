üöÄ UC2: Implement Logging with SLF4J in Spring Boot

This guide helps you add logging to your Spring Boot application using SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java). Logging is essential for tracking application behavior and debugging issues.

‚úÖ Steps to Implement Logging

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch for UC2 to keep changes separate.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure SLF4J is included in the project dependencies.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a controller to handle API requests and log messages at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Customize logging levels in the application properties file to control log verbosity.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run and test the application using a browser, Postman, or cURL.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Check the logs in the terminal or the generated log file.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Commit and push changes to the UC2 branch.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Create a pull request and merge into the main branch after successful testing.

üéØ How to Test the Logging API?

Start the application and access the endpoint:

http://localhost:8080/api/log

Check the logs in the console or log file for INFO, DEBUG, WARN, and ERROR messages.
